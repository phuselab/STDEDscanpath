# Scaled Time Delay Embedding Distance

MATLAB porting from https://github.com/dariozanca/FixaTons/ that includes an implementation of the metric described in *"Simulating Human Saccadic Scanpaths on Natural Images", by Wei Wang, Cheng Chen, Yizhou Wang, Tingting Jiang, Fang Fang, Yuan Yao*

Time-delay embedding are used in order to quantitatively compare the stochastic and dynamic scanpaths of varied lengths.
